# Commit-Tweet-test

If you will be able to **improve** or **simplify** my clumsy attempts at styling strings (so that they will fit to Twitter and Github). I make them in switchPost.js at the end of the code (this weird converters), I will be more than blessed

I also didn't have enough mana to do a live updateContent. This means that every time someone enters something into the contenteditable, the div will be updated to what will be the output.
I stopped doing this livePreview because I didn't know how to keep the text cursor in the right place after such an update.
_So for now I just added a preview button._
